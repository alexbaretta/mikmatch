Installation of Mikmatch version 1.0.0 or higher
================================================


The recommended way of installing mikmatch and a bunch of other packages
is from GODI (godi_console) available from http://godi.camlcity.org/
or from your favorite packaging system.


Otherwise, there is the manual install:

Prerequisites:
-------------

You must have installed:

  - OCaml including Camlp4 (versions 3.10.2 and 3.11.0 should be OK;
    versions up to 3.09.3 will not work).

  - PCRE-OCaml (http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html)


Everything will run smoothly if you have:

  - Findlib, i.e. ocamlfind 
    (http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html)
  - Gnu make
  - an Sh-compatible shell


Compilation:
-----------

  make

Installation:
------------

  make install


Uninstallation:
--------------

  make uninstall

Options:
-------

By default, only mikmatch_pcre is built and installed.
Mikmatch_str can be built and installed with the following commands:
  make str            # compilation
  make install-str    # installation
  make uninstall-str  # uninstallation
