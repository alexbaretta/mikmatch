General:
- Port to the new camlp4 -> micmatch-redux

Documentation:
- mention all the rules which are overridden, since it may 
cause incompatibilities with other extensions which do the same

Compatibility:
- (maybe) add an option for using another keyword than "match", and 
avoid to have to delete existing rules
- see if it is possible to use the features of Declare_once without 
inserting a new level at the top (otherwise micmatch has to be loaded 
last or other syntax extensions are forced to specify LEVEL "top" for their 
extensions of the str_item entry)

Features:
- port to Str the macros which already exist for PCRE (if possible)

Packaging:
- it would be nice to detach regexp-pp, and detach the internal tools
  from regexp-pp that are used by micmatch (sent request to the author
  2005-01-28). Update 2008-05-05: micmatch-redux will most likely
  remove the dependency on regexp-pp.

Possible optimizations:
- computation of only the substrings that are effectively used (or at 
  least which name appears in some expression)
